# Airbnb-Rental-Income-Revenue-Prediction

Objective:

The project aimed to predict the success of Airbnb listings in London based on historical data, with "success" defined by revenue (price Ã— number of reviews). The goal was to identify key factors driving rental income and provide actionable insights for hosts.

Key Steps:

Data Exploration

Datasets Used: Listings (property details), Reviews (customer feedback), and Neighborhoods (contextual data)

Findings:

Listings data had 75 columns with missing values.
Reviews data showed high user engagement (1.5M records).
Price distribution was right-skewed, with most listings priced low.
Apartments dominated the market.
Strong correlations between features like review_scores_communication and review_scores_location.

Feature Engineering:

Created a binary target variable ("Good"/"Bad") based on median revenue.
Normalized numerical features (price, reviews) to mitigate outliers.
Used one-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., property_type).

Modeling:

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier (chosen for robustness and interpretability).
Training: 70-30 train-test split.

Results:

Accuracy: 78%.
F1-score: 0.78 (balanced precision/recall).
Key features: price_norm (86.6% importance), reviews_norm (13.4%).

Key Insights:

Pricing & Reviews Matter: Listings with competitive prices and moderate review activity were more likely to succeed.
Revenue as a Metric: While useful, revenue alone may overlook factors like guest satisfaction.
Model Strengths: Random Forest provided interpretable feature importance but had room for improvement.

Conclusion:

The project successfully identified pricing and review activity as key drivers of Airbnb listing success. The Random Forest model achieved decent accuracy (78%) and offered actionable insights for hosts. Future work could address data gaps and test advanced algorithms to refine predictions.

Final Note: This analysis bridges data science and business strategy, demonstrating how data-driven decisions can optimize rental income in the sharing economy.
